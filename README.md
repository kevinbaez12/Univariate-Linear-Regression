# Univariate-Linear-Regression
In this project I utilized Numpy & other python libraries to make a prediction of the profitability of a bike sharing company when only a single variable was given to us. Utilizing a machine learning algorithm of batch gradient descent, I was able to predict the profitability of the company outside of the scope of the data provided to us in the dataset.
